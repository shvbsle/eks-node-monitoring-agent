# EKS Node Monitoring Agent

The EKS Node Monitoring Agent detects health issues on Amazon EKS worker nodes by parsing system logs and surfacing status information through Kubernetes `NodeConditions`. When paired with Amazon EKS node auto repair, detected issues can trigger automatic node replacement or reboot.

For detailed configuration options and usage documentation, refer to the [Amazon EKS Node Health documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/node-health.html).

## Overview

The agent runs as a DaemonSet on each node and monitors for issues across several categories:

- **Kernel** - Process limits, kernel bugs, soft lockups
- **Networking** - VPC CNI (IPAMD) issues, interface problems, connectivity
- **Storage** - EBS throughput/IOPS limits, I/O delays
- **Container Runtime** - Pod termination issues, probe failures
- **Accelerated Hardware** - NVIDIA GPU errors (XID codes), AWS Neuron issues, DCGM diagnostics

For each category, the agent applies a dedicated `NodeCondition` to worker nodes (e.g., `KernelReady`, `NetworkingReady`, `StorageReady`, `AcceleratedHardwareReady`). These conditions integrate with Amazon EKS node auto repair to automatically remediate unhealthy nodes.
